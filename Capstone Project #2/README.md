The US Adult Census Dataset was retrieved by Barry Becker from the 1994 US Census Database.

Throughout the project, there will be various tasks performed such as: 

Data Cleaning -  To deal with missing data, in the following data there were data that had ‘?’, this was converted to ‘nan’ and then dropped from the dataset.
Data analysis -  To better understand and conceptualize the data
Machine Learning Models - Decision Tree Model, Logistic Regression Model, Random Forest Classifier Model and SVC Model will be used to determine the training accuracy.
Model Tuning - GridSearchCV will be used to get a higher accuracy.
