# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
For my capstone project, I used a dataset that can be retrieved from Kaggle under the title House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. This dataset has 79 explanatory variables, each variable describes a feature of a residential house in Ames, Iowa. The objective is to find the best algorithm to predict the final price of each home using advanced regression techniques. The best model from the methods I have computed was the gradient boosting regressor. After hyperparameter tuning this model I retrieved an RMSLE of 0.00936. 

Throughout the project, there will be various tasks performed such as: 

* Data analysis -  To conceptualize the data, remove unnecessary variables, deal with missing data and handle outliers 

* Inferential Statistics - This will help to observe between homes that have 2 bedrooms above grade versus 3 bedrooms above grade. 

* Machine Learning Models - Linear regression, random forests, decision tree regressor, extra trees regressor and gradient boosting regressor will be used to determine the training accuracy, root mean squared error (RMSE), root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and R-squared. 

* Model Tuning - Hyperparameter Tuning will yield a lower error.
